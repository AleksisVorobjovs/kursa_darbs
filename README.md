This is a snake game made by @TokyoEdTech and new features added by me.
To use it you will need MySQL database, python3, and make your own config.ini file.
To see if everything is set up correctly run script.bat it will test if all files are present, check if config file contains valid values, execute migrations if there are any available and run the game.

config.ini example
[Color]
bg = 90,90,90
head = 220,0,0
food = 81,255,68
score = 5,5,5
trail = 100,0,0
[DB]
host = ****
db = ****
user = ****
